# Usually this file is not checked in to git.
# Also, usually this file is named ".env" rather
# than "DotEnv" (which makes it a hidden file).
#
# Generally things like passwords to databases
# are put in here (our database URL does not
# have a password). That's why the .env file is
# hidden, and why it isn't checked into a git repo
# (at least one that is public facing) because it
# contains stuff like passwords, API keys (which your
# institution has paid for) etc.
#
# But in this case I'm giving the file a non-hidden
# name and checking it into git because this is a demo.
#
# See demoFastapi.py for how this is used.
#
# Set the database URL.
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///../database/halphaOct2025.db
