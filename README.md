# softwareTalk_FastAPI

Slides, example code for a talk on FastAPI.

## General structure

Slides are in HTML. To run the code (optional) it is assumed that the Python
package manager uv is installed. For the speed comparison
with Rust, the Rust compiler needs to be installed. Standard
methods for installing these are available for common architectures
with a simple internet search. A reasonably recent version of
Python is required.
