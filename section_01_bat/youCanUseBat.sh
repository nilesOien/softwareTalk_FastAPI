# "bat" is a replacement for "cat" - don't pipe output
# to a pager like "less", though, you'll miss the color
# coding. It has a pager built in. Written in Rust.

# To see it work with git :

# Remove this line

# Then add some lines under here

# And modify this line.

# .. then look at this file with bat
