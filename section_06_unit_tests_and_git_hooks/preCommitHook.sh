#
# $ cd ../.git/hooks/
# $ ln -sf ../../section_06_unit_tests_and_git_hooks/preCommitHook.sh pre-commit
#
# Once this is installed as a pre commit hook, both
# unit tests and ruff code check have to pass for
# git to accept a commit. Hook scripts have to exit
# with 0 status for the requested action to go ahead.
# It's also possible to have pre-push hooks, I just like
# pre-commit hooks more.

# Make sure we're in the right directory.
